# @munin92/n8n-nodes-kraken

Fork of [DirectorVector/n8n-nodes-kraken](https://github.com/DirectorVector/n8n-nodes-kraken)
that adds **Get Ledgers** and paginated ledger/trade history (one item per entry, Kraken id as `id`).
Install in n8n as `@munin92/n8n-nodes-kraken`.

This package provides an n8n node with multiple operations to utilize the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange API.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
>
> This package is considered production-ready for the author's use case, but broader testing is ongoing.
>
> While `n8n-nodes-kraken` has proven stable in real-world usage, it has not yet been widely tested across diverse workflows. Users are encouraged to try it out and report any issues or feature requests.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice on Real-World Usage**
>
> This package enables direct interaction with the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange via the `node-kraken-api` wrapper. It is capable of placing **live orders** that involve **real funds**.
>

> ⚠️ **No Sandbox or Test Mode Available (yet)**
> 
> The underlying dependency (`node-kraken-api`) does not support Kraken's sandbox environment. As a result, **all trades executed through this node are real and will affect your actual Kraken account balance.**
>
> Please use this node with extreme caution. Ensure that your workflows are thoroughly tested in a safe environment before executing any operations on live accounts. The author is not responsible for any financial losses or unintended trades resulting from the use of this package.
>
> **Double-check your credentials, order parameters, and automation logic before executing any of the [Trading Operations](https://github.com/DirectorVector/n8n-nodes-kraken/edit/master/README.md#trading-operations).**
